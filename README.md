# Determine Michaelis-Menten parameters from experimental data

This is a web app for fitting experimental data to the Michaelis-Menten equation for the "Bagel" project, an ongoing effort in the Siegel group. Clone the app and run locally to use. It currently doesn't have a public-facing web home. 

## Notes 

+ It's got a lot of scientific Python dependencies. For this reason, the prereqs are [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) installed
