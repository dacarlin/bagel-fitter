# Determine Michaelis-Menten parameters from experimental data

This is a web app for fitting experimental data to the Michaelis-Menten equation for the "Bagel" project, an ongoing effort in the Siegel group. You can use this app to analyze data from a single assay plate from the [`bagel-protocol`](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-protocol).
