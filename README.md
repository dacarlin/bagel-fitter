# Data analysis tools for determining Michalis-Menten constants and thermal stability  

This is a web app for performing nonlinear regression and producing statistical plots. It is used for fitting experimental data to the Michaelis-Menten equation and thermal stability data to the logistic equation for "the bagel project", an ongoing effort by undergraduate researchers in the Siegel group to characterize the functional parameters of enzyme mutants. 

## Hosted use for Bagel Team 

The app is hosted at http://bagel.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu for those on UC Davis campus. You can use this app to analyze data from the [`bagel-protocol`](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-protocol).
