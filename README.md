# Determine Michaelis-Menten parameters from experimental data

This is a Flask app for fitting experimental data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. It's got a lot of scientific Python dependencies. For this reason, I recommend you install the Anaconda Python distribution. 

Clone the app and run locally to use. It currently doesn't have a public-facing web home.
